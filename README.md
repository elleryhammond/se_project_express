# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This is the back-end code for my WTWR application. The objective of this project was to create a server with an API and user authorization. During this phase of the project the Express project was built, a database was created and connected to the server, the initial routes and controllers were configured, and errors were handled. The following tools were used: Express, MongoDB Compass, and Postman. Helmet middleware was also introduced to set security headers for the API.
